      “Study Abroad”
      
      As a first generation student, you might feel at a disadvantage to the rest of your peers. However, a first generation student is just a label. You are the only person that can define your experiences, so don’t let that label stop you from seeking options and opportunities. Ever since I arrived to Cornell, I wanted to study abroad, be pre-med and major in plant sciences. I was following everything I thought I needed to do in order to become a naturopathic doctor. Since I had this mentality, I attended the meetings that discussed studying abroad. It was certainly possible to study abroad. My plan was to study for a summer or semester. To prepare myself, I needed to plan ahead the following semesters. Financially, studying abroad is not out reachable during a semester because there are no further charges than the original tuition payment.
      The real problem here was me. I was reaching out and preparing my future the way I thought needed to be done. Still, I didn’t stop to focus on myself. I closed my mind to other possibilities and limited my time to studying, going to office hours, and going to meetings with my academic and pre-med advisor. Meanwhile, I was slowly breaking down spiritually, emotionally and mentally. By the end of the second semester, one of my professors had recommended me to study abroad through CELA Belize because an ethnobotany course was offered. At the time, that course was the only one that sparked my interest and I decided to take a class that I actually enjoyed. Therefore, I applied to a grant and started working, so I could raise enough money for the summer. Thankfully, I got the grant and was able to study in Belize. Belize is certainly an unforgettable magical place. It was there that I learned about something I was passionate about. I enjoyed being surrounded by the people, the food, the culture, fauna and flora. So far, there has not been anything I have seen that is more beautiful than Belize. This experience taught me to keep an open mind and always reach out and network because it is primarily by networking that you can achieve your goals. I am not lying when I say that there are people who want to help you. If there is someone that doesn’t, don’t take it too personal. Listen and then move on to a different person, so that you are informed of the vast possibilities you have before choosing a career. Don’t be shy; get out of your comfort zone because that is when your life begins.

      “Enjoying Me-Time”
      
      Before starting my first semester at Binghamton University, I was worried how I was going to fit in. Everyone has always told me college is supposed to be a fresh start; where you can be anyone you want to be. Well, the real question was, who did I want to be? The most important thing I did, in my opinion, right before starting off, was setting my priorities. Being a first generation scholar meant that my main goal had to be my education, for me and for my family. I had worked hard to get the grades I could and had to keep those grades up if I wanted any chance at going to medical school. I also knew that I had to do something other than just study or I would go crazy. A social life is very important and hard to maintain in college. This was a challenge I faced that took me a while to get used to.
      
      During high school none of these challenges existed. It was easy to study all the time and go out to a movie with your friends every few weeks. But in college, I realized, there was so much more time for myself than for my parents. That was very new to me. Having to decide what I wanted to do with my free time was very difficult at first. I felt different from others because I felt like I had a responsibility to my Latino family to do well in all my classes and not distract myself with other activities. I soon learned that everyone needs something to distract themselves with at times. So, I tried out for the Binghamton University Cheerleading Team and made it! The team keeps me busy and has introduced me to so many wonderful girls. I now have a great group of friends, get to cheer on the Binghamton Bearcat Basketball Teams and get to spread spirit to my school while keeping myself occupied and relaxed. Looking back at my first semester, I am glad I took the time to try out the cheer team because I am now able to keep myself busy and organized.

      Reflections on my first year at Princeton…
      
      Growing up as a low-income, first-generation immigrant, I never imagined that I would end up at Princeton University. All I knew was that I had to work hard not only to be successful but also to support my family and to be able to give back to my community as a college-educated professional. Along my journey, I faced numerous obstacles, from devastating family health issues to the stressful limitations of my undocumented status. Every single day was a struggle, but it was my American Dream that kept me from crumbling in the face of adversity.
      Princeton has blessed me with so many opportunities, and I couldn’t be more thankful to the people who helped me get here: my family, my friends, all my teachers in New York, my High School guidance counselors, the amazing people who work for and collaborate with Latino U College Access, and the generous donors who contributed to my full scholarship.
      
      At this point, I would like to share a portion of the most difficult essay I have ever had to write: my college essay.
      
      “Even in the midst of despair, it’s at that very moment that we are left with the most important decision: we can either give up and hide in the shadows or stand up and savor the sun.
      As dawn conquered dusk, I finally realized that I didn’t belong in the darkness and that there is no such thing as a “bad” experience. I knew that I wasn’t a victim because every hardship in my life had cultivated the passion, determination and empathy that make me who I am.
      I am the former undocumented immigrant whose fourteen years of struggle have inspired him to pursue the American Dream, hoping to learn, grow and contribute to the sweet land of liberty.
      I am the diligent and conscientious student whose academic challenges went hand in hand with a powerful work ethic.
      And I am the future psychiatrist whose personal experience with mental illness has inspired him to discover the mysteries of the human mind and change the world from the inside out.
      Ultimately, by connecting my experiences like the pieces of a nesting doll, I found the light I was looking for, but little did I know that it was never beyond my reach; it was within me all along.”

      Sandra was born in Ica, Peru, and arrived in the US with her family when she was eight.  Going to college “…means I am representing the dream of my family to pursue a college degree and my own dream of becoming a professional.  I wish to complete my master’s in order to encourage my sisters that they can do the same and also to show appreciation for the opportunities I have.”
      
      Sandra says many Latino U programs helped her, particularly the college essay writing workshop, the SAT/ACT summer program and being paired with her Volunteer College Coach, Meaghan McCarthy.  “It was very helpful to have my college coach when I started my college application process.  I was able to write an essay that was a great representation of who I am.”  Her Volunteer Coach Meaghan describes Sandra as “A determined, well-rounded young woman, Sandra’s thirst for knowledge and commitment to her academic and extracurricular pursuits embody a strength of character.  Her innate resilience will lead her to great collegiate achievements and lifelong success.  I continue to admire Sandra’s fortitude and proudly cheer her on to her next adventure.”
      
      Sandra was accepted as a 2015 student to Boston University. Sandra also received acceptances to Fairfield, Hofstra, LaSalle, and Loyola (MD). At BU, she plans to complete a double major in International Relations and Affairs, and Foreign Language, to prepare her for a career as a future diplomat or politician.
